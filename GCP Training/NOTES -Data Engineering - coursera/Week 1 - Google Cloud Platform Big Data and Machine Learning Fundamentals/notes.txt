=========Google Cloud Platform Intro============

Long term shift:
First Wave
    - Computers under desks
Second Wave
    - Data Centers
Third Wave
    - Virtual data centers
    - Pay per provision

Google's mission is to organize the world's information
Google buys 1 out of 5 CPUs on the planet - wow!

The cloud is most beneficial when you run things just when you need them.

You can view GCP Big Data Products by functionality 
    Foundation
        Compute Engine
        Cloud Storage
    Databases
        Datastore
        Cloud SQL
        Cloud Bigtable
    Analytics and ML
        BigQuery
        Cloud Datalab
        Translation API, Vision API, ...
    Data-handling frameworks
        Cloud pub/sub
        Cloud Dataflow
        Cloud Dataproc
        
No-Ops = No systems engineer required. Simply submit jobs.

Journey to the cloud: When customers join GCP they
    Change where they compute
        Faster & Cheaper
    Improve scalability and reliability
        messaging -> pub/sub
        data processing -> dataflow
                                      or spark w/ dataproc (resize clusters very quickly)
    Change how they compute
    
Google Cloud offers ways to...
    Spend less on ops and administration
    Incorporate real-time data into apps and architectures
    Apply ML broadly and easily
    Become a data-driven company
    
pre-emptable machines offer 80% discount (the opposite of fault-tolerant)
    For instance: You can have 10 standard VMs and 30 pre-emptable VMs
    whereas 10 can get the job done bare minimum, but the extra pre-emptables improve the service greatly
    
Lab 1 Create a compute engine instance
    Task 1: Create Compute Engine instance with the necessary API access
        view machine info:
            cat /proc/cpuinfo
        update
            sudo apt-get update
            sudo apt-get -y -qq install git
            git --version
            exit
